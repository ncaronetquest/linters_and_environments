# Python Linters & Environments Demo

This repository demonstrates how to use modern Python linting and environment tools such as **Ruff**, **Black**, and **UV**.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

- `demo_project/app.py` â€“ Contains poorly formatted code for demonstration.
- `setup.sh` â€“ Script to set up the environment, install tools, and run linting/formatting.
- `.venv/` â€“ Will be created by `uv init` (not tracked in version control).

## ðŸ§ª Tools Used

| Tool     | Purpose               | Notes                          |
|----------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Ruff     | Linting & auto-fixes   | Very fast, many rules built-in |
| Black    | Code formatting        | Opinionated and consistent     |
| UV       | Environment management | Replaces pip, venv, virtualenv |

Make sure uv is installed. If not, install it from https://github.com/astral-sh/uv.

# âœ… Goals
Understand the value of linting.

Learn how to set up isolated environments.

Use modern tools to keep code clean and consistent.
